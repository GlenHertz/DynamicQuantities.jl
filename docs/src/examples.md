## 1. Solving a Chemistry Homework Problem

On your chemistry homework, you are faced with the following problem on the photoelectric effect[^1]:

> In a photoelectric effect experiment, electrons are ejected from a titanium surface (work function ``\Phi = 4.33\mathrm{eV}``) following irradition with UV light.
> The energy of the incident UV light is ``7.2 \cdot 10^{-19} \mathrm{J}`` per photon. Calculate the wavelength of the ejected electrons, in nanometers.

Let's solve this problem with `DynamicQuantities.jl`!
```jldoctest examples
julia> using DynamicQuantities

julia> using DynamicQuantities.Constants: h, m_e

julia> Φ = 4.33u"Constants.eV" # work function
6.93742482522e-19 m² kg s⁻²

julia> E = 7.2e-19u"J" # incident energy
7.2e-19 m² kg s⁻²

julia> p = sqrt(2 * m_e * (E - Φ)) # momentum of ejected electrons
2.1871890716439906e-25 m kg s⁻¹

julia> λ = h / p # wavelength of ejected electrons
3.029491247878056e-9 m

julia> uconvert(us"nm", λ) # return answer in nanometers
3.0294912478780556 nm
```
Since units are automatically propagated, we can verify the dimension of our answer and all intermediates.
Also, using `DynamicQuantities.Constants`, we were able to obtain the (dimensionful!) values of all necessary constants without typing them ourselves.
